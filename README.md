# `axum`

Coq formalisms for the `axum` project.

To compile the project from the command line, use `make` from the project root.
You may need to set the `COQBIN` environment variable appropriately before this
will work.

To have imports work while developing these files interactively in the CoqIDE,
the IDE needs to be configured to read from the `_CoqProject` file. If you have
problems with imports, check the IDE's "Project" settings.
